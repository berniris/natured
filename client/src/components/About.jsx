    <h1>Nature'd Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>Build the best product, cause no unecessary harm, and use business to inspire and implement
    solutions to the environmental crisis</p>
      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>Founded in 1987, Nature'd grew out of a small
      company that made tools for climbers. In the mid-90's we grew our
      business to include clothing and gear for fishing, hiking, skydiving, running and camping.
      Staying true to our core values during thirty-plus years in business has helped us create a company we're proud to run and work for.
      We pledge to always deliver on the highest quality sports gear available on the market. </p>
